I logged 34 reads in 2024. I finished most of those. I started renting audio books from the library. I started borrowing Kindle ebooks from the library too.

I started this post back in January and just really haven't had the energy to finish it! There's something incredibly exhausting about writing meaningful thoughts on a dozen different books. Even when the thoughts are short!

Instead of well thought out words - here's a bulleted list!

- **The Hainish Cycle** by Ursula K. Le Guin - I really liked **Rocannon's World**, but **The Dispossessed** and **The Left Hand of Darkness** were also highlights.
- **The Broken Earth Trilogy** by N.K. Jemisin - loved **The Fifth Season** the most
- **The Soldier Son Trilogy** by Robin Hobb - **Forest Mage** was my favorite of this series. I'm a big Robin Hobb fan.
- **Harrow the Ninth** by Tamsyn Muir - this is my favorite in this series so far
- **Ghost in the Wires** by Kevin Mitnick and William L. Simon - this was a really fascinating read about early hacking
- **City of Theives** by David Benioff
- **The Library at Mount Char** by Scott Hawkins
- **The Goblin Emperor** by Sarah Monette
- **Perilous Times** by Thomas D. Lee - Arthurian knights in modern times, good popcorn
- **The Manager's Path** by Camille Fournier - did this on audio book and found it useful to consider relationships with my managers from their perspective
- **Neuromancer** by William Gibson - really funny to read this and go "wow pretty cliché" only to remember this is where the clichés started
- **The Lonely Castle in the Mirror** by Mizuki Tsujimura
