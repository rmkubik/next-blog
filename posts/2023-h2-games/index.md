I have been playing way fewer video games the last few months. I've been working on my own projects, reading, and playing board games instead.

### Hitman: World of Assassination - Freelancer Mode

This was the mode of Hitman I needed to actually GET it. I was too focused on story missions when I last played. I would just keep reloading saves so I could get a perfect play through the end of a story mission.

Freelancer mode actually inspired me to keep playing through my mistakes and actually deeply learn the game's systems to overcome this.

This game is awesome and very fun and it is what I've played the most this year still.

### Gestalt OS

This is an awesome puzzle game. One of my favorite games this year so far. One of my favorite puzzle games in all years!

Current contender for: ‚ÄúPair Programming For Aliens‚Äù spiritual successor to XBPTH from Last Call BBS in 2022.

### Terra Nil

This was a weird game for me. I sort of hated it at first and then quit. And then I watched some other people play it online and came back and enjoyed myself.

There's something really interesting here about my misalignment of expectations of the game here. I do not think this is a "reverse city builder". I think this is a light, beautiful puzzle game.

I also think this misalignment made me way more angry than it might in other circumstances, because everything about this game made me think it would be one of my favorites of all time.

### Nonograms

Nonograms are a good simple and engaging puzzle. I enjoy this more than I ever did Sudoku, and it has replaced Knotwords Minis for me. I have played a TON of them on my phone this year.

### Doing Poorly and Living with Myself

This game was very emotional and felt very relevant to me when I played it.

Very very good. (I'm tired right now, but this deserves more words later)

## <Icon>üé≤</Icon> Board Games

### Spots

I love the aesthetics on this game. My first play of it didn't really go well. It felt sort of flat and boring with two players.

Every time I've played since I've gotten warmer and warmer on it. At this point, I really like Spots. Especially at 3 & 4 player counts, but I like it more at 2 now as well.

I think there's something about the randomness involved in this game and the unpredictability of new sets of tricks. It's hard to know if a game will feel good or not.

Also, I missed a pretty critical rule in most of my plays of this game that would've helped.

All in all, really happy to own this game now!

### Star Realms

Played this a ton with my brother, I love this game! I thought I didn't like deck builders after some distaste with Ascension in 4 player games many years ago.

I now think deckbuilding works wayyy better in two player. I feel like I actually have agency over the game and can actually counter pick cards.

I just picked up the Colony Wars expansion and am looking forward to trying that out too.

### Cosmic Encounter

I had a bad time playing this the first time. I was playing it wrong and I think the rigidity of the rulebook and mechanics nudged me in the wrong direction. I thought this was a war game about winning by inches and thinking hard on every decision.

Instead, this is a game with a super well defined possibility space so that each game 4 players can totally blow those rules up with WILD special alien rules. It's a game about wild nonsense happening and having a great time.

This game generated so many fun moments and so much great table talk on my second play. I'm excited to get to play it again.

### Spicy

This game is gorgeous. This is just a good version of the classic card game Bullshit/Cheat. It has done well every time I've brought it out. And unlike the classic game, this game ENDS in a reasonable time.

### Hive

I love these pieces. I love that this is an abstract game that is fun and quick to play. This game is also my go to, bring it with me anywhere. It can play outside, at the bar, in the wind. So good.

### Caesar

Played a few games of this. Really promising! I really liked this! The games are quick, the mechanics feel interesting. I don't feel like I'm near mastering it, but I do already feel like I've learnt a bunch. We played 3 games in about 2 hours.
