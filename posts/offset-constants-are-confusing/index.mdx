title: '"Offset" constants are confusing'

"[Magic numbers](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)>)" are commonly maligned in code because they're confusing. They don't communicate the intent of the code.

```ts
avatarContainer.position.x += 32;
```

Why is there a random **32** here? If I add more content to this container, how much should I adjust by? Should I change it at all?

Sometimes, especially in UI-related code, I see these magic numbers stuck into a constant with "offset" or "adjust" in the name. We know not to let the **32** float on its own without a variable declaration. But how helpful is this name?

```ts
const SIMPLIFIED_VIEW_OFFSET = 32;
avatarContainer.position.x += SIMPLIFIED_VIEW_OFFSET;
```

Saying "this is an offset" doesn't give me clues about how to change this number in the future. Okay, sure, we're offsetting something in this view, but _why_ is this offset **32**? I still don't know how to maintain this value in the future.

Often, these values are just an arbitrary number of pixels that a developer thought looked good enough. What other elements of the design caused this number of pixels to look right?

In reality, these should probably not be a single baked value but actually be a composition of more meaningful variables:

```ts
const SIMPLIFIED_VIEW_OFFSET = (AVATAR_WIDTH + 2 * AVATAR_BORDER_WIDTH) / 2;
```

or even:

```ts
const BORDERED_AVATAR_WIDTH = AVATAR_WIDTH + 2 * AVATAR_BORDER_WIDTH;
const SIMPLIFIED_VIEW_OFFSET = BORDERED_AVATAR_WIDTH / 2;
```

Looking for the logic behind where a good-looking number came from really helps future developers modify the code.

I'll take:

```ts
const hourInMs = 60 * 60 * 1000;
const dayInMs = 24 * hourInMs;
const delayedCheckTimeout = dayInMs * 2;
```

over:

```ts
const delayedCheckTimeout = 172_800_000;
```

any day.

Although something like a `Duration` from [luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/api-docs/index.html#duration) is even better here... <Note>Working with dates and times is a mess... It's a great place to use a library!</Note>

```ts
Duration.fromObject({ days: 2 }).toMillis();
```

It can mean a little extra effort beyond picking your initial magic number to understand _why_ it works. Sometimes it really is just a magic number - but usually there's a little more going on. If you can put that in your code it'll save someone a lot of pain in the future.
