Welcome to The Goaties! <Note icon="🐐">Game of the Year - GOTY - Sounds like "goat" "ie" - ha ha ha?</Note>

I logged around <strong>123</strong> games this year. <Note>I switched note-taking systems this year and I haven't bothered ironing out all the duplication. It's almost certainly less than 123 games.</Note>

I did a [mid year check-in](/blog/2023-h1-games) on what I played. It's interesting to see what carried through and what didn't. I didn't get around to publishing my GOTY post last year, my [most recent is from 2021](/blog/what-i-played-2021).

I split up a bunch of the notable games into a few categories:

- [Favorites](#favorites)
- [Honorable Mentions](#honorable-mentions)
- [Board Games](#board-games)
- [Watched](#watched)
- [Games I'm looking forward to](#games-im-looking-forward-to)

## Favorites

### Hitman World of Assassination - Freelancer Mode

<Badge color="aliceblue" icon="🛝">
  Systemic Sandbox I
</Badge>

I've always heard stories about the emergent game play in [Hitman](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1659040/HITMAN_3/). It generates interesting scenarios. It immerses you in its systems. I've played before and had a good time, but I never really got to that place of systemic immersion.

With the release of [Freelancer Mode](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23581384/hitman-3-freelancer-mode-roguelike-world-of-assassination), I decided to give Hitman another shot and I finally _get it_. I was too focused on reloading saves every time I goofed trying to finish story missions previously. Freelancer mode encouraged me to keep playing through my mistakes and deeply learn the game's systems.

I finally get it; Hitman is awesome. It is my most played game this year by far.

### Gestalt_OS

<Badge color="aliceblue" icon="👽">

<Badge color="#FFCDD2" icon="❤️">
  Inspiring Indie
</Badge>

[Gestalt_OS](https://games.increpare.com/Gestalt_OS/) by [Increpare](https://www.increpare.com/) is my favorite puzzler of the year, and one of my favorite puzzlers of all time.

The game is presented as a cryptic Windows 95 application from another planet. It has a tool bar of abstract icons and none of them make any sense. The main pane is a grid you drag the icons onto and then they do things. Sometimes.

You experiment your way through the game by combining the symbols and learning their rules. I love the feeling of deciphering a system that initially seems utterly nonsensical.

Gestalt_OS was great fun to co-play on Discord with my friend Brendan. We've had fun co-playing other cryptic games in the past. [Cinco Paus](https://smestorp.itch.io/cinco-paus) and "X’BPGH: The Forbidden Path" in [Last Call BBS](https://www.zachtronics.com/last-call-bbs/) really remind me of this experience.

### The Roottrees are Dead

</Badge>

[The Roottrees are Dead](https://jjohnstongames.itch.io/the-roottrees-are-dead) by jjohnstongames is one of the best deduction games I've every played.

I got into them last year with [Return of the Obra Dinn](https://obradinn.com/) and [Case of the Golden Idol](https://www.thegoldenidol.com/).

I _love_ the early nineties Internet theming this game does so well.

Jotting down notes in a notebook is great.

This is the best version of Obra Dinn since Obra Dinn.

### Mosa Lina

  Inspiring Indie
</Badge>

[Mosa Lina](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477090/Mosa_Lina/) is a "hostile interpretation of the immersive sim" by [Stuffed Wombat](https://stuffedwomb.at/).

I really like how this game plays with mixing designed and generative elements. I've lately been discovering I'm really into systemic games. I originaly thought I was into "roguelikes", but have been finding a lot of games lately that pay with systems in more interesting ways. The rogueike formula is just one.

Playing Mosa Lina pass the controller with a few friends was great. It's set up as competetive, but you still work together to clear a set of levels. Cheering for your friends to pull off a whacky combo and clear a particularly hard level is a ton of fun.

### Doing Poorly and Living with Myself

<Badge color="aliceblue" icon="💙">

</Badge>

[Doing Poorly and Living with Myself](https://noahkittleson.itch.io/dpalm) (DPALM) by [NoahKittelson](https://noahkittleson.itch.io/) is a very personal and well-written visual novel.

I don't have the words to properly express my admiration of this project, but here's the author's description of the game:

> Doing Poorly and Living with Myself is a short semi-autobiographical Visual Novel about work, stress, imposter syndrome and burnout. I started writing it after quitting my own job, to help relieve & explore the guilt of having given up on a job I worked so hard to get, and so hard to keep. For anyone else who has also done poorly, I hope this can help you live with it.

It's about an hour to play and free to download. If anything in that description resonates with you, please play the game. Then, kick Noah a few bucks if you feel it was a good use of your time.

I played DPALM after being laid off earlier this year. The situation Noah goes through is not identical to mine, but many elements resonated with me. Playing it was a great use of my time.

## Honorable Mentions

### Pigments

<Badge color="aliceblue" icon="🕹️">
  Best Arcade Game
</Badge>

<Badge color="aliceblue" icon="🛋️">
  Couch Play II
</Badge>

<Badge color="#FFCDD2" icon="❤️">
  Inspiring Indie
</Badge>

[Pigments](https://benjamin-soul.itch.io/pigments) is a free arcade game originally made by [Benjamin Soulé](https://www.benjaminsoule.fr/) as part of the [Disc Room Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/disc-room-game-jam).

This year, Pigments had a [commercial re-release](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2339080/Pigments/) as part of [PUNKCAKE Delicieux](https://punkcake.club/) with new levels and content. I don't think this was a dramatic upgrade over the original free version. However, both versions of Pigments are amazing and I'm very happy to be able to kick them some dollars for this game.

I played this on Steam Deck couch co-op with my partner and her brother. Passing the controller around to try and beat some of the harder levels was a ton of fun.

### Old School RuneScape - Trailblazer Reloaded League

<Badge color="aliceblue" icon="🍔">
  Comfort Food
</Badge>

[Old School RuneScape](https://oldschool.runescape.com/) keeps showing up in [my](/blog/most-influential-games#runescape) game [posts](/blog/what-i-played-2020#old-school-runescape-trailblazer-league). The big common thread in my writing on RuneScape is nostalgia and a very chilled out gameplay pace. It is apparently my go to "turn my brain off" game.

That said, the [Trailblazer Reloaded League](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Trailblazer_Reloaded_League) is actually super cool. Every few years, Old School RuneScape does a league where you start a new character for a month with up to x12 experience gain and a bunch of game breaking items.

I've lately been really into the idea of recontextualizing a super deep game space that you ignore most of the "non optimal" parts with a new framing that suddenly gets you DEEP into parts of the game you'd long ago written off.

### Invisible Inc

<Badge color="aliceblue" icon="🕵️">
  Tactical Innovation
</Badge>

[Invisible Inc.](https://www.klei.com/games/invisible-inc) is a stealth tactics games by [Keli](https://www.klei.com/) from a few years back.

I used to be way more into tactics games, but I find it so hard to get into them these days. I think there are a lot of common flaws that come from the grid based tactics formula.

Invisible Inc's stealth and objective oriented game play instead of "kill all the enemies" oriented gameplay really unlocked stuff for me.

### Terra Nil

<Badge color="aliceblue" icon="❤️‍🩹">
  Conflicted Feelings
</Badge>

[Terra Nil](https://www.terranil.com/) by [Free Lives](https://freelives.net/) is described as a "reverse city builder", but I think it's more of a narrative focused puzzle game.

This was a weird game for me. I hated it at first and quit out of frustration. Then, I watched some other people play enjoying it and came back and enjoyed it myself.

There's something really interesting here about my misalignment of expectations of the game here. I do not think this is a "reverse city builder". I think this is a light, beautiful narrative focused puzzle game.

I also think this misalignment made me way more angry than it might in other circumstances, because everything about this game made me think it would be one of my favorites of all time.

### Subnautica

<Badge color="aliceblue" icon="🏛️">
  Cool Piece of History
</Badge>

[Subnautica](https://unknownworlds.com/subnautica/) by [Unknown Worlds](https://unknownworlds.com/) is a survival adventure crafting game set on an ocean planet.

It felt like jumping in a time machine back to the "every game is a survival crafting game" era.

It was also super cool to compare this title to [Outer Wilds](https://www.mobiusdigitalgames.com/outer-wilds.html). It felt like a lot of what Subnautica was doing narratively was refined in Outer Wilds.

Also, being in an Ocean was truly wild. And I really cannot overstate how unique and interesting that experience was.

### Moonring

<Badge color="aliceblue" icon="💫">
  Almost Amazing
</Badge>

<Badge color="#FFCDD2" icon="❤️">
  Inspiring Indie
</Badge>

[Moonring](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2373630/Moonring/) by [Fluttermind](http://www.fluttermind.com/) is a "retro-fusione" of classic turn based RPG experiences in a pretty modern presentation.

I've always been interested in old school games like this, but every time I try to get into them I bounce off. I love Moonring for presenting these game concepts in a WAY more palatable format.

Moonring feels a little long in the tooth right now. There are SO MANY super cool and interesting moments and mechanics. If the game lasted half as long, I think Moonring might've made it out of the Honorable Mention category.

As it is, there was just a bit too much padding in between the cool parts. However, the game seems to still be in active development and I'm SUPER optimistic it'll keep getting better as the game gets filled out.

## Board Games

### Cosmic Encounter

<Badge color="aliceblue" icon="🥇">
  Simply the Best
</Badge>

At first glance, [Cosmic Encounter](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39463/cosmic-encounter) by Bill Eberle, Jack Kittredge, Bill Norton, Peter Olotka, and Kevin Wilson appears to be a war game about conquering your opponents' planets. In reality, it is about becoming a whacky alien with game breaking abilities, politicking, and drama.

I misplayed this as a war game where every inch counted for my first play and had a bad time taking it too seriously. On subsequent plays, I've really embraced doing dramatic, fun, and stupid stuff and had a blast playing Cosmic Encounters.

I cannot wait to play again and see what ridiculous aliens hijinks we get up to next time.

### Caesar! Sieze Rome in Twenty Minutes

<Badge color="aliceblue" icon="♟️">
  Chess + Go, but better?
</Badge>

[Caesar!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/338957/caesar-seize-rome-20-minutes) is a lightly Roman themed board game by Paolo Mori. You place tokens on regional borders that influence each side of the border with different weight, and try to win the majority.

It turns out that I really like abstract strategy games. I'm just really not into the "homeworkification" of popular lifestyle abstract strategy games like Chess and Go.

Caesar! has a lot of the same feelings I've found in Go and Chess. Offering exchanges you think will be advantageous to your opponent. Trying to surround their territory so that you can prevent their growth.

That feeling of intead of just doing move A, I'll do move D that influences my opponent to do C, which leads to me doing B and NOW I can force _them_ to do A.

I talked about [Hive](/blog/2023-h1-games#hive-pocket) in my mid year check in, and while I still love that game, Casear! has taken it's place for me lately.

### Dune

<Badge color="aliceblue" icon="🎲">
  Best Game Night
</Badge>

I watched a bunch of really fun playthroughs of [Dune](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/283355/dune) by Bill Eberle, Jack Kittredge, Peter Olotka earlier in the year.

My partner bought it for me laster in the year. It seemed like way too involved of a game to actually ever get to the table. However, having the game got me into planning an awesome 6 hour game night with dinner <Note icon="😋">If you're in Portland, Swagat Indian Cuisine NW is delicious! Great for game night!</Note> and snacks <Note icon="😋">Busted out some Korean Melon for this. Great snacking fruit!</Note> to get it played.

I love so much about this game. It is wild and epic.

### Cat in the Box

<Badge color="aliceblue" icon="🧼">
  Good Clean Fun
</Badge>

[Cat in the Box](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/345972/cat-box-deluxe-edition) by Muneyuki Yokouchi (横内宗幸) is a quantom trick taking game, where you declare the suits of your cards as you play them.

I've never really played trick takers much before outside of [The Crew](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/284083/crew-quest-planet-nine). This was a really big eye opener for me on how awesome that relatively simpe mechanic is.

I can really see why half of the card games you can learn with traditional card games are trick takers.

### For Northwood

<Badge color="aliceblue" icon="👤">
  Solo board games are good, actually!
</Badge>

[For Northwood](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/334590/northwood-solo-trick-taking-game) by Wilhelm Su is a solo trick taking game.

As a singleplayer video game designer, I'm always fascinated with the idea of solo board games. It's interesting to see what affordances they gain and lose compared with video games.

I feel like there's a lot of interesting inspiration to draw from them.

For most solo games I've tried though, they don't really click. <Note>I haven't really tried _that_ many to be fair! [Food Chain Island](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/309110/food-chain-island) is another one I liked a lot. That was my previously favorite solo game before For Northwood.</Note>

I feel the rules overhead of solo games A LOT more than I think I do in a communal setting. It's a lot of work to teach yourself all of a game's rules before playing. There's a reason I love video games without tutorials that just dump you in and let you start experimenting and learning at your own pace.

I think For Northwood is brilliant though. It was surprisingly easy to get started playing and I think it does a lot by piggy backing on just how interesting trick taking is as a mechanic.

### Mechabellum

<Badge color="aliceblue" icon="🍞">
  Best RTS Since Sliced Bread
</Badge>

[Mechabellum](https://store.steampowered.com/app/669330/Mechabellum/) by Game River is the best new RTS I've seen in a long time. It's also technically an autobattler... But I feel like it captures something great about RTS games I can only scratch the surface of in tradtional RTS games.

A lot of games branched off of the RTS genre focus on the tactical elements. MOBAs like DOTA 2. Other games like Tooth and Tail focus leaning into the real time nature and simplifying the control schemeo of the game.

Mechabellum focuses on maintaining the deep strategical counter systems in RTS games while removing base building and actual real time elements.

I never thought a game with this structure would _feel_ like an RTS, but it really does. It also makes this deep area of RTS games that newbies like me never get a chance to think about.

### Decked Out 2

<Badge color="aliceblue" icon="🤩">
  Most Impressive
</Badge>

[Decked Out 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoVVCwx6k1w) by [TangoTek](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4YUKOBld2PoOLzk0YZ80lw) is a push your luck deck building dungeon crawling game built entirely in survival Minecraft.

It blows my mind the scope of this project. It's not _just_ an awesome game built in Minecraft. It's an awesome game period.

It's an adaptation of the board game [Clank](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/201808/clank-deck-building-adventure) to a real time 3d environment. It makes full use of that full range of development and deep use of Minecraft mechanics. There's an ingame "HUD" using maps. You need to sneak and watch how much noise you make. There are keys and treasure to collect. A card deck system. And there's a mountain of redstone powering it.

The game also has an interesting "league" sort of scope being part of an ongoing Minecraft content creator community server. The game is consitently being changed in response to players gameplay. There is a metaprogression system where your deck improves over the weeks you play.
