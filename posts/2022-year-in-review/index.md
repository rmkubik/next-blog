I have found it useful to reflect on the past year over the holidays. These reflection posts end up changing format every year. I've meandered from self critiques to just posting personal game of the year lists.

I usually start with a giant bulleted list of everything significant I can recall from the year. Then I start expanding on the various items as they grab my interest. Then I burn out around halfway and either give up or cut 90% of the post!

## 2022

I think most of this year has been a sort of reflection on what I want to happen next in my life. I had a lot of goals earlier in my life around career and making games.

I hit my three year anniversary working on TwilioQuest in 2022. It is by far the longest I have ever worked on a single project. The two big goals I've had in my career thus far were to work on games full time and ship a game myself.

## I played games this year

My tracker says 141 of them! Yikes! That's a lotta games. This is probably part of why I worked on so few projects compared to previous years.

I had a lot of trouble narrowing down my favorite games this year. I ended up with a few categories.

### My TOP faves

#### Elden Ring

Pretty hard for any other game to by my favorite this year. This has actually been an atypical year for me where one game actually stands alone in this way. I just put so many hours and got so many different emotions out Elden Ring. I've never played a "souls-like" prior to this, and think this was probably the perfect one for me to start with. I won't dwell on it much, since I suspect this is not going to be a very unique inclusion for this sort of list this year.

#### Slice & Dice

Slice & Dice is a really clever turn based strategy game.

Dice Tribes: Ambitions, is another sweet dice game I mention below. It goes in very different directions than Slice & Dice. But, it is really good too. I guess maybe I'm a Dice Gamer now?

#### Last Call BBS

Love it. Played a lot of programming games this year. I streamed several for work and played some in my own time as well. Last Call BBS had such a good selection of experiences though. I love minigame collections and am a HUGE sucker for faux operating systems in one game.

Shout out to a few other great programming games I played this year: The Signal State, Silicon Zeroes, and A=B.

#### Barony

Best multiplayer experience by far. This is a co-op first person roguelike. It is SO good. The most accessible roguelike I've ever played I think. And feels like it hews really close to more traditional roguelikes.

#### Return of the Obra Dinn

This genre is awesome. This game put me off for a while. It seemed like it would be too "fancy" for me. But after Outer Wilds I was convinced to try it out since I heard this game was also a mystery game. I loved it! There were a lot of frustrations, but overall the sort of "whodunnit"-ness of this game was absolutely amazing.

#### Vampire Survivors

Love it. I imagine this will be a popular inclusion on many 2022 lists. This was the perfect Steam Deck game.

#### Shotgun King

Love it! I love a good tactics game. The short sessions and turn based nature made this my go to Steam Deck couch game for _many_ hours.

### Honorablest Mentions

These were all right on the edge of being in my TOP list.

#### Marvel Snap

Really cool game. My go-to mobile game for the end of the year. Really reminds me of Air, Land, & Sea which is a board game I also played this year.

#### Hitman 3

My first Hitman game! This was really sweet. I enjoyed this a lot and it took me a little bit to acclimate myself. I really loved the murder mystery level a lot.

#### Knotwords

I played a LOT of Knotwords puzzles. They're sort of like sudoku-esque word jumbles? I don't think there's a concise way to describe them, but it's a pure logic puzzle that uses letters and words.

Knotwords minis were a really good phone game for me this year. They're easy to put down if you need to run and super easy to start another if you have time to keep playing.

I admire the minimalist nature of this game, it FEELS a lot like a classic logic puzzle that should've been around forever. I think its word validation is integral to the game experience though, so it is probably a uniquely digital experience. Between Knotwords and Wordle

I've really come to appreciate how much just using letters and words gives you for free in game design. You get to piggy back on so much interesting interaction built into language. Zach Gage, the author of Knotwords, has talked about this before and I've really started to appreciate it now.

#### Linelith

Dope! Higher on the list?

### Still Honorable Mentions

I loved these games too. Most of these games had a more obviously related game that I enjoyed in their niche in the pervious two categories. That helped me split them down into their own section. However, I did want to shout them out any way.

At some point I also had to accept that I just cannot write about all of these games and actually ship this post!

<CloudList>
- Case of the Golden Idol
- Windjammers 2
- Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition
- Mini Motorways
- Oh My Git!
- Deep Rune
- Core Keeper
</CloudList>

### Board Games

For the first time in a long time I played a bunch of board games! I had some regular sessions with friends this year. It feels so good to get back into playing board games after a long time away.

#### Crokinole

Crokinole is a dexterity based bar game popular in Canada. You have a circular board where you flick little wooden disks to score points. It's similar to shuffleboard, but on a much smaller round board.

I impulsively ordered a board back in 2021 from a Kickstarter campaign. Some folks I knew said this was a great way to pick up a good board for cheaper. It has been super worth it! It's a very fun game. It seems to play best one-on-one, but we've had fun playing with 2, 3, and 4 players. It is never not funny to bring this giant disc shaped bag that everyone assumes is an enormous cymbal to board game night.

#### Lost Cities

I'm blown away by how simple this game is and yet how engaging it still is. There aren't many rules. I can play many sessions of Lost Cities in a row and they feel very different each time.

#### Root

Root feels like the opposite of Lost Cities. There are a hundred rules and each players factions are totally different. There's still an incredibly satisfying design feat of tying all these disparate factions together. Root also facilitated really fun interactions between us as players and is a great game to _make_ a board game night around.

We played Root digitally as well which is fun. But it doesn't have the same fun as playing on tabletop. It's a lot more fun to scheme against the evil cats when their player gets up for a drink. Root's app in async mode doesn't really facilitate all the important discussion and negotiation that is required for the game to feel great.

### Other Good Board Games

These are some of my other favorite boardgames from 2022.

<CloudList>
- Bananagrams Duel
- Love Letter
- Anomia
- Air, Land, & Sea
</CloudList>

### Small Games

I love small games. These are usually short games that can be finished or experienced in an evening. They're usually created by a single author. I really like playing a lot of small games because they're so unique.

#### Combo Pool

I think Combo Pool might be one of the best Pico 8 games I've ever played.

#### Lost Settlers

Lost Settlers is fascinating! It is a super interesting blend of real time and turn based strategy games. I've been really into both of these genres for a while. But I've steered away from real time due to the challenge in playing and designing those games.

Lost Settlers blew my mind by showing me a super compelling formula for doing "real time turn based". It _feels_ a lot like playing a tiny version of Age of Empires without the same stress. I'm really interested to create something inspired by Lost Settlers.

#### Stacklands

This "turn based real time" sort of genre is super compelling to me. Stacklands does a solid job of applying time pressure in a super manageable way. The pause button really brings it home too.

I love the way discovery works in this game too. The game reveals itself to you slowly and compellingly over the play session. You're presented with a variety of different goals that grow and morph into your larger ultimate goal.

## 2023

- Write more
  - Actually publish stuff
  - Give myself better options for shipping. I only publish blog posts right now that I've thought through, planned, and edited. But I've written a ton in my personal notes. Some of it even in blog post format. But, I just never really get to the editing step and push it over the line. I'd like to give myself an option for marking posts as "less than perfect" on my site. I'm hoping this will let me actually publish more writing and get better at it.
- Ship more projects
  - Help re-contextualize shipping. There are a lot of projects I work on that don't go anywhere. And that is fine, I'd like to consider "shipping" these as just writing a short post about them in Discord or on my blog.
  - Give myself better ways to ship
  - I have several projects, some mentioned above, that I got to a place where they're interesting, but I just lost interest in _finishing_ them. I'd like to go back and actually ship them.
- Read more non-fiction
  - I did "mock up monday" this year and it was awesome
  - I want to pick a day to read a chapter of non-fiction each week too
