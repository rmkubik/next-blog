I have done a yearly retrospective for a few years in a row now. I find it interesting to look back at what I thought was important in years past. [Last year's review](/blog/personal-retrospective-2019) was a lot more relatable to me than the one I wrote [a couple of years ago](/blog/personal-retrospective-2018).

These retrospectives start with a review of the year compared to my plan for the year. Then I follow up with some expectations for the upcoming year.

## A 2020 Review

On the whole, this was not a stunning year of progress. As I look back on the middle and later parts of my year I now realize I was feeling pretty burned out. I had a similar, though more extreme, experience in 2017. I think that's part of what led to my over zealous year review for 2018. With this review, I want to try and recognize that some years are slower than others. A slower year does not necessitate a frenzied start to the new year.

My plan for last year coming out of 2019 emphasized I'd avoid seeking out "success" in 2020. I'd become pretty disillusioned and burned out as the year came to a close. I wanted to avoid a similar burn out experience in 2020. This ended up being partially successful!

- giving myself permission to not try and force hobby projects to be successful let me have a healthier relationship with them
- I still had some self imposed pressure to _finish_ the projects to some degree, i think this did end up with me actually getting more projects shipped in the end. it's hard to know how much of this is just my amount of practice going up over time, but it's nice either way!
- i think a future experiment might be "setting the definition of success at a reasonable level explicitly". shipping my games being the only ambiguous goal also let me overextend myself on accident without realizing i was doing this.

### The big obvious note - there was a pandemic

I felt like it didn't have that much impact on my life at first. Especially give my luck to have been working from home already in a field where that is the norm.

At the end of the year though, I can confidently say it did have an effect on me. I think a lot of my energy for creative pursuits and following through on them came from community. It's so much harder to find that inspiration when everything is virtual.

When I look back at this year, I didn't have the year I hoped I would at the outset. However, given these wildly unusual circumstances I think I made the best of it.

### I burned out on wildfire, we did not ship it

We originally planned to ship at the beginning of the year. Instead, we were burned out from pushing so hard at the end of 2019.

We did not work on the project for a significant chunk of the year.

There were a few periods where we got into a rhythm of work on the project. But, we've reached this period of development where we're just taking what we can get.

### I stopped sharing in public

What was it all for?
Do I want to be a public figure at all any more?
Do I care if my projects have an audience?
I stopped tweeting and blogging and newslettering
I like scrolling back through my public log of past projects

### I didn't try to find my creative voice

I have decided you can't force this discovery...

### Friendship!

- I have built friendships a lot better this year. I feel pretty calm and content on this front in a way I didn't going into the year.

### I played a lot of games this year

I played a lot more games with friends this year than ever before. This includes online multiplayer games, but also Discord calls where one of us plays through some of a single player game. I'd love to find some space for this even after it becomes safe to hang out in person again.

I also played a lot of games I have a lot of nostalgia for. It was nice to play a lot of comforting and familiar games while everything else in the world was unfamiliar. Additionally, a lot of theses older games have changed a lot since I played them when I was younger. Part of this is that I'm older and able to

Here are a bunch of the games that I played this year. I wrote more about [which made the biggest impact on my year over here](/blog/what-i-played-2020).

### My projects

- **[Status Code](/project/status-code)**<br/>
  I built this tactics game as part of the [JS13k game jam](https://js13kgames.com/). It's inspired by a Lego flash game I loved when I was younger called [Spybotics the Nightfall Incident](http://www.ericzimmerman.com/projects#/blank-5/).
- **[Warships](/project/warships)**<br/>
  This is an [AirConsole](https://www.airconsole.com/) project I made with my friend Oliver. This has actually been my most successful commercial project to date!
- **[Bombfinder RL](https://rmkubik.itch.io/bombfinder)**<br/>
  This is my second attempt at doing the [7 Day Roguelike Jam](https://7drl.com/). This project is much closer to a finished game! I'd love to revisit this concept some time. The core game play here seems pretty decent.
- **[Grim Repair](/project/grim-repair)**<br/>
  My third Global Game Jam in a row! I did the majority of the non-character art in this game as well as the level design.
- **Site Redo**<br/>
  I redid [the website you're reading this on](https://github.com/rmkubik/next-blog) using Next.js!
- **[Functional Game Utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/functional-game-utils)**<br/>
  I published a [rough version of the docs](https://functional-game-utils.netlify.app/) for my personal JavaScript grid based game utility library.
- **[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)**<br/>
  I did more Advent of Code then I've ever made it through before! I quit because I didn't want to do the work to solve later complicated problems, not because I felt like I couldn't hang! I published my code in [a GitHub repository](https://github.com/rmkubik/aoc2020) as I worked.
- **[Inventober](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3A%40ryrykubes%20inventober&src=typed_query)**<br/>
  A little bit of Inventober
- **[PIGSquad Talent Talk](https://pigsquad.com/events-list/pigsquadtalenttalks2020)**<br/>
  PIGSquad talent talk on building tools for your game dev
- **[Mentorship Saturdays](https://www.meetup.com/Mentorship-Saturdays/)**<br/>
  I continued helping run Mentorship Saturdays this year as a virtual meetup

### I did not read much this year

I thought that quarantining would lend itself to a lot more reading than in years past. However, I found I actually read less this year. There was a period of time during the summer where I would read in the park near my house. Other than that I did pretty much no reading. While I was reading though, I enjoyed reading [The Design of Everyday Things]() and [The 99% Invisible City]().

### Cool tech & tools I used

- **[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)**<br/>
  Tried this when looking for something with a few more opinions than the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) + [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) stack I used at work. I enjoyed the demo project tutorial a lot! Looking forward to using this more.
- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**<br/>
  Used this to move away from [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). I like the set of opinions it has. And it's simpler than Gatsby for my use cases. I might like something with even more opinions in the future, like for server side things.
- **[Wave Function Collapse](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/17/wavefunction-collapse-algorithm/)**<br/>
  An approachable procedural generation algorithm that I found a great tutorial for. I did [a little demo project](https://wavefunction-collapse-demo.netlify.app/) for it. This demo hasn't quite hit it's stride yet, but the algorithm still seems promising.
- **[Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)**<br/>
  Used this for the first time in Inktober. I found [a very nice non-pixelated dark theme for Aseprite](https://2dchaos.itch.io/minimal-dark-aseprite-theme) that has finally made the tool usable for me. This was Drew's using it's scripting interfaces for good stuff in [Wildfire Swap](/project/wildfire-swap). I have used [Pyxel Edit](https://pyxeledit.com/) for most of my other asset creation including Wildfire Swap's graphics and the tileset in [Grim Repair](/project/grim-repair).
- **[Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/)**<br/>
  I've been a fan of vector graphics tools for a while. For whatever reason they make more sense to me than digital painting/drawing tools have. I got Affinity Designer a few years ago and have used it on and off for various tasks and really enjoyed it. This year was the first where I used it to create game assets. I used it to make the controller graphics for Warships. I'm interested in trying other graphical styles than just the pixel art I normally use.
- **[Socket.io](https://socket.io/)**<br/>
  I did the chat demo for this software and found it to be surprisingly easy. I'd love to use it to create some sort of multiplayer web game soon.
- **[Dart](https://dart.dev/)**<br/>
  I had a great time doing a dart tutorial. The language was a lot of fun to use and I'd definitely be into using it again. I did not check out [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) yet, but it's on my list of things to consider for any desktop/mobile/web project I have.
- **[Mobx State Tree](https://mobx-state-tree.js.org/intro/welcome)**<br/>
  I enjoyed the structured nature of state management that [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) has given me on my current projects. I tried out Mobx State Tree and it feels like it has a lot of the things I liked about Redux without all the overhead. I'm looking forward to using it on a real project.

### TwilioQuest

Doing game development full time has left me with less energy and motivation to work on my own projects in my free time. It's not all bad though! On my least motivated days I'm still putting in more time on TwilioQuest than I ever have before making games.

I have learned a ton working on this project. Especially about actually delivering a game to players. I haven't had to deal with marketing, supporting, or community building before.

Lots of new challenges. I built my first full stack application this year.

### My favorite writing

I did not write as much publicly this year. I stopped publishing posts and newsletters around halfway through the year. I've continued writing very rough "blog posts" in my personal notes instead.

- [Using Design Pillars to Keep Wildfire Swap's Development on Track](https://ryankubik.com/blog/wildfire-swap-design-pillars)
- [Clean up your Twitter Experience with TamperMonkey](https://ryankubik.com/blog/remove-twitter-distractions)

I grew sick of the eternal "monthly blog post" treadmill this past year. I would like to start posting the rough posts I made in my own notes on this site soon. I think my main mistake was trying to commit to the monthly post.

## The rest of 2021

### We shipped Wildfire Swap!

### Get back to learning things

I want to spend time learning new things this year! I feel like I put a lot of learning to the side in the drive to finish Wildfire Swap and generally burning out. I want to learn for it's own sake and to level up some things I already do.

#### Writing & Communication

Keep practicing here!

#### Opinionated development tools

Generally things with opinions that let me get stuff done so I can spend more time making things and less time re inventing the wheel.

Branching out from the tools i'm comfortable with. Trying not to force my understanding of other tools onto new tools.

#### Productive game development tools

I like making games in JavaScript, especially React these days, but it's hard to find support from publishers or other game developers. Additionally, JavaScript doesn't port well to consoles. And like any good game developer, I have a dream to put a game on the Nintendo Switch.

- Godot
- Unity
- HaxeFlixel

#### Productive web tools

- continue learning about full stack stuff
- Meteor.js
- Parcel 2
- Dart + Flutter
- Next.js

#### Math & Algorithms

- Wave Function Collapse
- Behavior Trees
- State Machines

#### Shipping polished games

I want to understand better what makes a game "polished". I want to spend more time learning tricks and tactics for increasing polish.

- shaders
- aesthetic decisions

#### New graphics ideas

I'd like to explore some other ways of creating art, mainly for games. Currently, I feel reasonably comfortable with pixel art. I'm not amazing at it, but I'd like to start leveling up in other artistic domains too.

- aesprite
- affinity designer
- simple 3d modeling
- 2d drawing

#### Basic video editing

I did the Wildfire Swap trailer! In general, video editing seems like a really useful skill to have for marketing/promotion. But, also as a useful way to edit videos for documentation or communication.

### Sharing in public, without treadmills

A return to sustainable sharing in public. No more content treadmills!!!! What does sustainable posting look like? Seasons? What other ideas?

### Finish smaller projects

I want to work on more small projects after Wildfire Swap. It turned out to be an awesome ride and I'm really proud of what we shipped. But, I am really excited to work on projects with a much smaller scope. In particular, I'm curious what the smallest project I can build and sell to give people good value for their money.

### Publish more writing

I've been taking a lot of notes and blog post drafts down in Notion. But I've stopped publishing them. I want to get back in a better cadence of actually polishing them up and shipping them. I recently added a `wip` flag that I can set on posts I want to get online but aren't quite polished yet.

### Keep playing games
