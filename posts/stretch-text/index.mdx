I ran across the idea for [StretchText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StretchText) from [The New Media Reader](https://monoskop.org/images/4/4c/Wardrip-Fruin_Noah_Montfort_Nick_eds_The_New_Media_Reader.pdf) excerpt on [Computer Lib/Dream Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib/Dream_Machines) by Ted Nelson.

Ted's StretchText idea allows a reader to adjust the "depth" of a piece of writing. It would a reader to control how much information is on screen as a complement to scrolling.

As you adjust the depth on a piece of text, or "stretch" it, more words appear in between the initial words to expand upon the ideas in the text.

I thought it would be fun to try and craft a piece of StretchText. The header to my site seemed like an easy place to start.

At the moment, I don't have a good way to insert this into my blog posts directly so I have hosted it on a different page of my site.
