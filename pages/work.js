        <p>
          Since it was a small team, I did all sorts of non development tasks
          too. From lesson planning educational content to helping new learners
          in Discord.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was promoted to team lead by the time I left. I was responsible for
          coordinating content from myself, an artist, and content developer.
          Additionally, I worked with a contractor team to manage our services.

          and artwork for the game.
