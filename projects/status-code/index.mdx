This game was built over the course of a month for [the JS13k game jam](https://js13kgames.com/). The theme of this jam was `404` and this jam has an additional requirement that all submissions must be 13kb (13,312 bytes) in size or smaller after zipping.

This project was built with a minimal component-based JavaScript framework called [Hyperapp](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp).

The original jam submission was tagged at `1.0.0` on GitHub and clocked in at 13,144 bytes, 168 bytes under budget.

Status Code was inspired by an old Lego web game called [Spybotics: The Nightfall Incident](https://brickipedia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Nightfall_Incident).
