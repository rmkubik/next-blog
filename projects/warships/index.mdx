Combat on the high seas! Search and destroy your opponent's fleet!

I designed and built this game with a friend inspired by the classic game Battleship in a couple of months for [AirConsole](https://www.airconsole.com/) as a project to test the viability of commercial projects on the platform.

For context, from their marketing copy:

> AirConsole is an online video game console.
> Your smartphones are the gamepads.
> Your browser is the console.
