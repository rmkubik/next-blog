## About

Island Maker was created during the month of February 2022 as part of Ryan's [1GAM](https://onegameamonth.com/). This game was also an entry to the [Eggplant Community Jam](https://itch.io/jam/hexes-eggplant-podcast-community-game-jam-12) where the theme was "Fun with Hexes". The excellent games [Tiny Islands](https://dr-d-king.itch.io/tiny-islands) and [Carcassonne](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/822/carcassonne) inspired Island Maker's mechanics.
